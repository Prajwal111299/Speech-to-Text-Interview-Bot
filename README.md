# Speech-to-Text-Interview-Bot

• Created a Speech-to-Text Interview Bot using Python, NLTK, and sci-kit-learn that processes a CSV file of questions and answers, utilizes TF-IDF vectorization for training, incorporates speech recognition for user input, and evaluates the user's responses against optimal answers to calculate a recruitment probability.
• Also, integrated a Web UI for the chatbot using Streamlit.
