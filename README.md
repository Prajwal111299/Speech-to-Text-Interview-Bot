# Speech-to-Text-Interview-Bot

Created a Speech-to-Text Interview Bot using Python, NLTK, and scikit-learn that processes a CSV file of questions and answers, utilizes TF-IDF vectorization for training, incorporates speech recognition for user input, and evaluates the user's responses against optimal answers to calculate a recruitment probability. Demonstrated the functionality through a client demo video and completed code shipment using AnyDesk.
